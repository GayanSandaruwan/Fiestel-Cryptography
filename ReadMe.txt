Run the program!

When asked provide a key with 8 charactors (64 bytes in ASCII)

File Chooser will be prompted to choose the file to be encrypted!
Select a text file. -> will be encrypted an be saved in the project directory with plaintext file name+ "encrypted.txt"


Now willagain ask for the key to decrypt.
Follow as same above will store the decrpted file in project directory with encrypted file name + "decrypted.txt"


In here i have implemented a Fiestel Network. Can decide the number of rounds for encryption.
But when the number of rounds exceed 1, Decrytion doesn't work. Tried hard to debug & still trying.

Project is available at git hub repository , https://github.com/GayanSandaruwan/Fiestel-Cryptography.git
